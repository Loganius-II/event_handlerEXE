# Event Handler Application

## Brief overview of this project:
  - Originally built using python
  - Converted to distributable file using pyinstaller
  - used pygame

## To run this:
  - open the `dist` file
  - download all of its contents
  - You **need** to download the entire `dist` file in order for it to work
  - double click on `event_handler.exe`
  - It *should* open a cmd window that displays the event handlers
  - It *should* **also** open a new window labeled: `event handler`
  - The `event handler` window is where you clicks and keystrokes register
  - the only implemented keys are: `UPARROW`, `DOWNARROWW`, `LEFTARROW`, `RIGHTARROW`, `A KEY`, `MOUSEUP`, `MOUSEDOWN`
